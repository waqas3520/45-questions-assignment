// No Users: Add an if test to Exercise 28 to make sure the list of users is not empty.
// • If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!

// • Remove all of the usernames from your array, and make sure the correct message is printed.


// Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a array, 
// such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
// • Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a array.

// • Loop through the array.

// • Use an if-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number.
//  Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.
